        Paragraph 1. Sun Wukong is a monkey that was born from a rock on top of the Huaguoshan mountian. Eventually he
        became the king of a group of monkeys after showing his bravery by jumping throw a waterfall that the
        other monkeys where afraid of, proving that he didn't fear anything. But Sun Wukong did fear one thing, he
        feared death, so Sun Wukong dicided to go on a journey to find immortality, that's how he found his first
        teacher, Puti Zushi, and first layer of immortality. Sun Wukong's teacher taught him how to be immortal, how to
        fight, also various spells to hide from the gods of heaven who didn't approve of the method of immortality that
        sun wukong gained, some spells that Puti Zushi taught Sun Wukong were, these are the more well known abilities,
        the 72 early transfomation, the ability to dublicate, and more. Also Puti Zushi named the monkey king Sun
        Wukong. After years of training Sun Wukong returned to his home, where it was ransaked by a deamon so he went
        and free his subordinate from the demon, so then he gave most if not all the monkeys. But when it came down to
        it Wun Wukong couldn't find a weapon sutiple for him so he traveled to the underwater kingdome to ask the dragon
        king for a weapon but even then Wukong couldn't obtain a weapon sutible for him. Eventually Wukong found a
        sutible weaponin the form of a magic changing staff, named Ruyi Jingu Bang, which originally was used to measure
        the ocean, also the staff ways about 17,500 punds or 7,960 kilograms and he usualy puts it in his ear. So Wukong
        went back to his home, also he caused quite a bit of trouble on earth that the gods in heaven notice him and
        dicided to give him a job in heaven to subdue is troublemaking but it eventually backfired. When Wukong accepted
        the inventation immediately, but whe he found out his position in heaven, which was the lowest position, he got
        furious that he caused quite the havoc in heaven before he left back to his mountian and people stated to call
        him "The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal" after hearing of what happened.
