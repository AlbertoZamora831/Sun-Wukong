        Paragraph 1. Sun Wukong is a monkey that was born from a rock on top of the Huaguoshan mountian. Eventually he
        became the king of a group of monkeys after showing his bravery by jumping throw a waterfall that the
        other monkeys where afraid of, proving that he didn't fear anything. But Sun Wukong did fear one thing, he
        feared death, so Sun Wukong dicided to go on a journey to find immortality, that's how he found his first
        teacher, Puti Zushi, and first form of immortality. Sun Wukong's teacher taught him how to be immortal, how to
        fight, also various spells to hide from the gods of heaven who didn't approve of the method of immortality that
        sun wukong gained, some spells that Puti Zushi taught Sun Wukong were, these are the more well known abilities,
        the 72 early transfomation, the ability to dublicate, and more. Also Puti Zushi named the monkey king Sun
        Wukong. After years of training Sun Wukong returned to his home, where it was ransaked by a deamon so he went
        and free his subordinate from the demon, so then he gave most if not all the monkeys. But when it came down to
        it Wun Wukong couldn't find a weapon sutiple for him so he traveled to the underwater kingdome to ask the dragon
        king for a weapon but even then Wukong couldn't obtain a weapon sutible for him. Eventually Wukong found a
        sutible weaponin the form of a magic changing staff, named Ruyi Jingu Bang, which originally was used to measure
        the ocean, also the staff ways about 17,500 punds or 7,960 kilograms and he usualy puts it in his ear. When he
        was asleep, beings from the underworld drag his soul to the underworld and when he woke up Wukong was furious
        because it violate the rule of immortality. So he wrecked havoc throw the underworld to find the rulers of the
        underworld, before he left he not only crossed out his name but also the names of all the other monkeys down
        from the book of life and death making him and the other monkeys immortal, Wukong gains his second form of
        immortality. So Wukong went back to his home, also he caused quite a bit of trouble on earth that the gods in
        heaven notice him and dicided to give him a job in heaven to subdue is troublemaking but it eventually
        backfired. When Wukong accepted the inventation immediately, but whe he found out his position in heaven, which
        was the lowest position, he got furious that he caused quite the havoc in heaven before he left back to his
        mountian and people stated to call him "The Great Sage, Heaven's Equal" after hearing of what happened. So
        eventually gave him another chance so the gods gave him another position, but it didn't go well. The gods gave
        him the job of taking care of the garden that contains the immortal peaches and Wukong ate all of the peaches,
        that is how he gains his third form of immortal. He also went to the banquet hall for the gods and drank the
        immortal wine that was in the kitchen of the banquet hall, gaining his fourth form of immortality. While he was
        drunk he went strolling around heaven until he found pills of immortality, gaining his fifth form of
        immortality. When he sobered up and realized what he did he left back to his mountian. When the Jade Emperor
        heard of what Wukong did he was enraged, the Jade Emperor declared a war against Wukong for the trouble he has
        commited. Wukong was capable of defeating the army of heaven, eventually he was captured and was put in Laozi's
        furnace so that it would remove Wukong's immortality within 49 days. When the gods check the furnace after 49
        days Wukong still had his immortality and was infuriated that he caused more chaos in heaven. Eventually the
        Jade Emperor ask the Buddha for help on stopping Wukong and his rampage. The Buddha made a deal with Wukong that
        if he was capable of leaping out of his hand Wukong would win and be the ruler of heaven. Wukong accepted
        immediately, so he leaped to the eged of the univers and back but Wukong still lost because he didn't left the
        Buddha's hand for he has trancended over everything. So the Buddha sealed Wukong on a mountain with a seal on
        top so he wouldn't break free from the mountian and Wukong was sealed for 500 years waiting until he is released
        from his imprisonment.
